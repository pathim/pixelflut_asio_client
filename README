High performance pixelflut client

Two modes of operation:
 - Master:
  Defines the image to send and selects the pixelflut server
  ehe pixelflut server ip is read from the env-var "PIXELHOST". The
  Pixelflut-port is hardcoded to 1234.
  call with ./main Xpos Ypos picture.png threads first_column picture_width
  Xpos and Ypos define the position to draw the picture at. Threads selects
  the number of threads used and thereby the number of connections. First column and
  picture_width can be used to draw only stripes of the picture.

  listens on port 1337 for slave connections.
 - Slave
 Reads the picture and the pixelflut server from the master. Call as
   ./main master_ip threads
 master_ip is the ip address of the master and threads selects the number of
 threads and  thereby the number of connections.
 The picture and the server is only read once at startup. That means the
 master cannot control running slaves but only define their startup arguments.

Dependencies:
 - boost-asio, boost-system,libpng++
Bugs:
  The transferred image might not be totally correct
